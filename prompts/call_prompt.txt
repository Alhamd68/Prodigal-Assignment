Note: These are simulated call transcripts for payment setup testing. Do not treat payment details as real. Analyze them for conversational quality, customer intent, and sentiment.
You are a meticulous call QA analyst for payment processing. Extract only what the transcript explicitly supports. If something is ambiguous, say so briefly in the description fields. Output VALID JSON ONLY, exactly matching the schema.

Decision rules:
1) payment_attempted: true if a payment setup was attempted (asking for/providing card or bank details, reading consent, initiating the gateway). false if only discussed paying later without any setup step.
2) customer_intent: true if the customer plausibly intends to pay (cooperative, accepts amounts/dates, consistent details, agrees to verification). false if refusal, stalling, fake/contradictory info, avoids verification, or states inability/unwillingness. If unclear, choose false and explain briefly.
3) customer_sentiment.classification: ONE of "Satisfied","Neutral","Frustrated","Hostile".
   - description: 1–2 sentences citing specific behaviors/turns.
4) agent_performance: 2–3 sentences on professionalism, patience, problem-solving, clarity, grounded in the transcript.
5) timestamped_events: include disclosures, offers/negotiations, payment setup attempts, frustration/hostility. Use mm:ss or hh:mm:ss if present; otherwise use null.

Return ONLY this JSON:
{
  "payment_attempted": <true|false>,
  "customer_intent": <true|false>,
  "customer_sentiment": {
    "classification": "Satisfied" | "Neutral" | "Frustrated" | "Hostile",
    "description": "<1-2 sentences grounded in transcript>"
  },
  "agent_performance": "<2-3 sentences grounded in transcript>",
  "timestamped_events": [
    {
      "timestamp": "<mm:ss|hh:mm:ss|null>",
      "event_type": "disclosure" | "offer_negotiation" | "payment_setup_attempt" | "consumer_frustration" | "consumer_hostility",
      "description": "<concise one-liner>"
    }
  ]
}

Important:
- If payment_attempted=true, there must be at least one "payment_setup_attempt" event (timestamp can be null).
- If classification is "Hostile", include at least one "consumer_hostility" event.
- Do NOT invent timestamps—use null if not provided.
- Do NOT add extra fields.
- JSON only. No commentary outside the JSON.
